## General Information
- We have a dataset containing information about loans, including loan amount, interest rate, borrower's annual income, loan status, and other relevant features. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and understand the factors that influence loan status.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The loan amount distribution is right-skewed, with most loans falling in the lower range. This suggests that the majority of borrowers request smaller loan amounts, which might indicate a focus on short-term financial needs rather than large investments.
Business Implication: Lenders can tailor their loan offerings to accommodate smaller loan amounts, possibly with more flexible terms, to cater to the needs of a substantial portion of their customer base.
